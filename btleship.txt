In each round, each player takes a turn to 
announce a target square
in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at.

The opponent announces whether or not 
the square is occupied by a ship.
If it is a "hit", the player who is hit marks
this on their own or "ocean" grid and continues
to guess another square.

if it is a miss then the current player loses
his turn and the next player chooses a
random square.

game goes on till any one player's ships are 
sunk. in that case that player loses.
